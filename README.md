# N-Puzzle Solver

A Python implementation of an N-puzzle solver using the A* search algorithm with Manhattan distance heuristic.

## Problem Description
The N-puzzle is a sliding puzzle that consists of a frame of numbered square tiles in random order with one tile missing. The objective is to arrange the tiles in order by making sliding moves that use the empty space.

## Features
- Solves NÃ—N sliding puzzle problems
- Uses A* search algorithm with Manhattan distance heuristic
- Checks puzzle solvability before attempting solution
- Reads puzzle input from file

## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/n-puzzle-solver.git
cd n-puzzle-solver
